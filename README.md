## File Structure

The main files in this directory are:

- `requirements.txt`: The file specifying the Python dependencies required by the application.

## Application Overview

The application is built using the `r2r` library. The main entry point is in the `src/app.py` file, which creates an application using the `R2RBuilder`. Learn more by readin the [documentation here](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/introduction).
